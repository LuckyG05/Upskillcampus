#  Quiz Game – Python Project

This repository hosts a command-line based **Quiz Game** developed using Python. This project was completed as part of my internship with **Upskill Campus** in collaboration with **UniConverge Technologies Pvt. Ltd (UCT)**.

The game allows users to attempt multiple-choice questions, tracks their scores, and maintains a scoreboard for future reference.

## Project Objective

The primary goal of this project was to develop a simple yet interactive Command Line Interface (CLI) based quiz application in Python that achieves the following:

-   Presents a series of multiple-choice questions to the user.
-   Accepts and validates user input for answers.
-   Accurately calculates and displays the user’s score at the end of each quiz session.
-   Saves each user's score persistently in a dedicated `scoreboard.txt` file.
-   Displays the history of previous user scores after each quiz attempt, providing a continuous record.
